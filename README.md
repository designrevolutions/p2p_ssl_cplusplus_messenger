C++ P2P SSL Messenger - using Boost ASIO

This is a C++ Project developing a C++ P2P messenger application.
The code uses Boost ASIO.

The core files are: 

client.cpp
server.cpp
ssl_certification folder

Everthing else is not needed and there for other purposes - like backup files I kep when developing on my laptop (previous to using Git and Github).

The code was developed in Visual Studio Code. Oh damn, that gave me so many problems. I'll try and document my troubles later.

A very important key part of compiling the exe files AND before that installing Boost and Boost ASIO is using MSYS2 terminal.
